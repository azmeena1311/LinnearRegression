As such, he is working on researching the bounciness of different balls so as to optimize the pit. He is running an experiment to bounce different sizes of bouncy balls, and then fitting lines to the data points he records. He has heard of linear regression, but needs your help to implement a version of linear regression in Python.\n\n_Linear Regression_ is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the _error_, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of _best fit_.\n\nWe will use loops, lists, and arithmetic to create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Part 1: Calculating Error","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nThe line we will end up with will have a formula that looks like:\n```\ny = m*x + b\n```\n`m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the intercept, where the line crosses the y-axis.\n\nFill in the function called `get_y()` that takes in `m`, `b`, and `x`.
